# Police Shootings Insights

With data from Washington Post on GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/master/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv), I fleshed out what factors lead a fatal police shooting to be more likely toward an individual of minority persuasion.

The age of the suspect seemed to be one of the biggest factors -- the younger the individual, the more likely to be black, Hispanic or Native American.

Summary of conclusions given in my blog:
